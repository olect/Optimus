Optimus PHP encryption/decryption algorithm

Why named Optimus?
--------------
Because it sounds cool...thats why!

About
--------------
This is a tool for encrypting and decrypting relatively large amounts of text.
It is purely written in PHP and can handle multilevel encryption for extra secure ciphers.
Can also run in CLI mode for terminal usage.

README - You are reading it now!
digest.php - This is where you set your encryption/decryption secret
encrypt.php - For encrypting stuff
decrypt.php - For decrypting stuff
index.php - A simple web interface for testing/using Optimus encryption/decryption

Usage
--------------
$encryption = new Encrypt("Text to encrypt", 1) // 1 is the level of encryption, accepts 1-6.
$encryptedData = $encryption->getEncrypted();

$decryption = new Decrypt("Text to decrypt", 1) // 1 is the level of encryption, accepts 1-6.
$decryptedData = $decryption->getDecrypted();

For decrypting you have to use the same decryptionlevel as encrytionlevel.

Encrypt/Decrypt CLI:
    Parameters
        - (String) Text to encrypt
        - (Int) Level of encryption
        - (Boolean) Print to screen
    Example:
        ./encrypt TextToEncrypt 1 false
        OR
        php encrypt TextToEncrypt 1 false

    With decrypt, just change ./encrypt to ./decrypt and remember executive rights
    with chmod 775 encrypt/decrypt.php for CLI execution.
