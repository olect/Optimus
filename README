About
----------
- This is a tool for encrypting and decrypting relatively large amounts of text.
- It is purely written in PHP and can handle multilevel encryption for extra secure ciphers.
- Can also run in CLI mode for terminal usage.
Files:
README - You are reading it now!
digest.php - This is where you set your encryption/decryption secret
encrypt.php - For encrypting stuff
decrypt.php - For decrypting stuff
index.php - A simple web interface for testing/using Optimus encryption/decryption

Usage
----------
$encryption = new Encrypt('Text to encrypt', 1) # 1 is the level of encryption, accepts 1-6.
$encryptedData = $encryption->getEncrypted();

$decryption = new Decrypt('Text to decrypt', 1) # 1 is the level of encryption, accepts 1-6.
$decryptedData = $decryption->getDecrypted();

For decrypting you have to use the same decryptionlevel as encrytionlevel.

Encrypt/Decrypt CLI:
    Parameters
        - (String) Text to encrypt
        - (Int) Level of encryption
        - (Boolean) Print to screen
    Example:
        ./encrypt TextToEncrypt 1 false
        OR
        php encrypt TextToEncrypt 1 false

    With decrypt, just change ./encrypt to ./decrypt and remember executive rights
    with chmod 775 encrypt/decrypt.php for CLI execution.
